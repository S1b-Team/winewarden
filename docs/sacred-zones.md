# Sacred Zones

Sacred zones are moral boundaries, not just paths.

Examples:
- User home outside the prefix
- SSH and GPG material
- System configuration directories
- System sockets and keyrings

Behavior:
- Redirect or virtualize when possible
- Deny silently when needed
- Record the decision after the session
